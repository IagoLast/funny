                <p>In the design area any source can be useful to create something new. Sometimes, we are too focused on getting
                    inspiration from things on the internet, other designerâ€™s projects or by a short brainstorming. Each
                    artist has its own creative process but looking for inspiration out of the comfort zone can help in some
                    cases. I started this project or visual experiment with the purpose of creating a colorful collection
                    of photographs to take chromatic palettes from.

                <div class="tag">The solution</div>
                <p>During a short trip around Portugal I took photographs of every colorful spot I found from north to south.
                    After putting all the images together the result looked closer to a chromatic representation of a country.
                    For each photograph I extracted a color palette with what I think were the predominant four tones along
                    with their Pantone coding. The design of the book itself is based on a simple grid composed by photographs.
                    It includes a short introduction of the project in the beginning. The general white aspect tries to highlight
                    the colors. The book is made in two different paper types, coptic biding and a hardcover with a window
                    in the middle.
